                <h1 class="card-title">The Nominal Group: MY SONESIS</h1>
                <p class="card-text">A noun group (phrase or clause) is a group of words that is made up of a noun or pronoun and words to describe that noun or pronoun. It is a group of words that has a noun or a noun equivalent as its headword. Within a nominal group, the headword (h) can appear alone, it can be preceded by a modifier (m) and a qualifier (q) can also appear after it. Take note that the modifier and the qualifier are optional since, as we have said, the headword can appear alone.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Take note also that, a group can be defined as a word or a combination of words that has a head word. If a combination of words does not have a headword, it cannot be referred to as a group. A headword is, therefore, the obligatory element of a group. When a group contains a single word, it is referred to as a single group but when it consists of more than one word, it is known as a complex group.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Every lexical word in English has (there is) a group that corresponds to it.</p>

                <p class="card-text">There are four major types of Noun groups in English:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Unmodified Head Type:</strong> This type has no modifier or qualifier. Examples: Girls are here, Bode is handsome.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Pre-Modified Head Type:</strong> This type has a modifier but no qualifier. Examples: The girls are here, Good cars are expensive.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Post-Modified Head Type:</strong> This type has a qualifier after the headword but no modifier before it. Examples: Lawyers of our time are liars, Something delicious is what I need.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Pre- and Post-Modified Head Type:</strong> This type has both the modifier and the qualifier. Examples: The young man in my room has traveled, All the other students who refused to buy the study material will be penalized.</li>
